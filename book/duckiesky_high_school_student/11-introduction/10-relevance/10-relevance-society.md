When we think of a robot, what definition could we reference? 

Robotics matter because they hold a part of the key to the future with efficiency for most if not all crafts. In essence it is an interdisciplinary research area part of Engineering and Science. It involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The end goal is to materialize the designs of intelligent machines that outperform a human being's ability in a specific task or replace said human in a task too complex or far too dangerous. Making them near perfect, multi use tools for industries and corporations of any kind. 

Today robots impact everyday life in the service industry, with potential to positively transform work practices.
